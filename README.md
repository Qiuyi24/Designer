# Designer
#In the past few weeks I have designed several pages for ZUMBA Club. 
#The first is the login page, and the second is the course reservation page. Customers can book lessons from the reservation page, which also includes videos about dancing.
#The third page is the course selection page, where customers can learn more kinds of dances.
#The fourth is the customer information page, through which Zumba employees can search for the customer's information after the customer has purchased the course and booked the course.
#The last page is about course sale. 
#I also chose a set of color schemes for the web design.
